# GameOfLife
Devised by John H Conway, Game of life is a cell automaton - a grid of cells with a finite number of states (Wikipedia). 
The rules are:
Given a cell:
If the cell is on/live and it has 2 or 3 live neighbors, cell survives
  Else the cell dies
If the cell is dead and it has 3 live neighbors, cell becomes alive/ is switched on
  Else cell stays dead
  
This simulation was built entirely with tkinter.
